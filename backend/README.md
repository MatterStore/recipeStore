# API Specification

See *Design Documentation > Backend > API Documentation* on Confluenc for a
diagram.

## Format

Endpoints should specify their request method and format. Request formats can
be specified in a JSON-like schema with JS typing, with a trailing `?` on a
type (e.g. `string?`) indicating an optional field. Any non-type requirements
e.g. authorization, should also be specified.
